# Credit Card Fraud Detection



## Overview

This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression or Linear Regressio. Credit card fraud is a critical issue, and this project aims to develop a model that can identify fraudulent transactions, providing enhanced security for cardholders.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains credit card transaction data with various features such as transaction amount, merchant information, and more. This dataset is essential for training and evaluating the fraud detection model. You can find the dataset kaggle.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA is performed to understand the distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions, as well as identify potential patterns and anomalies.


3. **Model Building:** Either a Logistic Regression or Linear Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict fraudulent transactions.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
